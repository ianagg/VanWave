*Global Game Jam 2017, 4 people, 48 hours* 

Simple reaction game. Destroy barbarian's ships before they destroy your castle. The game will show you a countdown, 
then the "GO" word will be displayed in a random time period.

**Rules**: Press the space button as soon as "GO" is displayed on the screen. You should not press the button before the "GO". 
You have limited time to react.
